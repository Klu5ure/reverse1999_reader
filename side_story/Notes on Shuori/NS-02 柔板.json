    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "湿润的气息，和土质。发现了吗？对于风暴过后，腐料还没深入土壤的阶段来说，这里的土质过于黏稠了。",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "The moist air and the soil. Have you noticed? The soil beneath our feet is way too sticky, even for a land after a thunderstorm."
  },

    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "虽然不是准确判断……但我倾向于认为，这是有地下水的标志。",

    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_text": "Fine. I told you how it works. Without new running water, the old samples in the bottles can only show us the way back. That's the best they can do."

    "english_text": "Can it show us the way back? Sure, but that's not what we want. Only Mr. Krolik and his men would be happy to hear that."

    "chinese_speaker": "旁白",
    "chinese_text": "听到这儿，年长的女人直起身来。虽然看不见眼神，但她沉默时的姿态，总是看上去在进行快速的思考。",
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_text": "Upon hearing this, Bessmert stands up straight. Although she cannot see her eyes, her silent posture alone seems to affect an aura of rapid thought."
  },

    "chinese_speaker": "小叶尼塞：",

  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "是的，我知道，我知道。因为我也一样。这并不意味着现在就往回走，它只是一份保障。",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "Yes, yes, I know. I feel the same. I'm not suggesting we turn back immediately. It's just an option."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "那种润湿量的土质，印象中最接近温带山地河滩，一般位于那种覆盖森林植物的黑土草原，和我们踏入这里所认识的地貌不同。",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "To the best of my recollection, such moist soil is often found in the mountains and floodplains of the temperate zone, especially in the forest steppes covered with chernozem. The landscape is very different from where we are now."

    "chinese_text": "在我们找到躲避的位置前，你曾向我描述过东南方有一座山切断了地平线，对吗？",

    "english_text": "Before we sheltered from the thunderstorm, you told me about a mountain in the southeast. It blocked the horizon from our sight, right?"
  },

    "chinese_speaker": "旁白",
    "chinese_text": "听到这句话，女孩睁大了眼睛。那是逐渐意识到关窍的惊喜表情。",
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_text": "The girl's eyes widen upon hearing these words—the expression of a hopeful epiphany."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "由此可以假设，我们遇上的风暴，正是强对流翻山而来的结果，在草原上，如果要形成这么大团的云雨，必须有足够的活水——",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "Based on this, I would assume, the thunderstorm was the result of a stronger convection coming from the other side of the mountain. Now, on the steppe, to form a cloud large enough to bring a thunderstorm would require a large amount of running water ..."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "小叶尼塞：",
    "chinese_text": "而活水的来源可能就在那个方向！！",
    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_text": "And the source of the running water is probably on the other side of the mountain!"
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "没错……有了这个大致方向，我们就能继续前进。",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "Exactly ... We can set off in that general direction."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "而且，即使得到最坏的结果，翻过山去，我们没有找到活水，你的神秘术也能带我们回来。",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "We might not find any water there. That's the worst result. In that case, we can still return here with the help of your arcane skill."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "只要玻璃瓶还在。",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "As long as we have that glass bottle with us."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "小叶尼塞：",
    "chinese_text": "是的。",

    "english_text": "That's right."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "然后，我们定下五天的期限……",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "We tell them we need another five days ..."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "旁白",
    "chinese_text": "别斯米尔抓紧了手中的玻璃瓶，像是抓住了最后一点希望。",
    "english_speaker": "Narrator",
    "english_text": "Bessmert grips the glass bottle in her hand as though clinging on to one final trace of hope."
  },
  {
    "chinese_speaker": "别斯米尔：",
    "chinese_text": "这可能也是他们能接受的最大期限。就算不行，我也会像游说时那样，再次说服他们。",
    "english_speaker": "Bessmert",
    "english_text": "They won't accept more days than that. If they won't even settle for this, I will convince them, like I did when I first got them on the team."
