    "english_speaker": "Yenisei",
    "english_text": "Remember the river our team found? Perhaps that was the lower course of the main river, and it included Jiŭ Niángzĭ's arcane power because the stream across her yard is near one of its branches. The running water might have diluted the arcane power in there."
